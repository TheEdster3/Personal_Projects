**Preface**
-------
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Racecar is a popular example of a palindrome, as an attempt to spell it backwards shows Racecar = racecaR.

**Program**
-------
This program will take any word passed to it by the user and identify all possible palindromes of the word by addition of it's own characters. 

Take for example the word Mississippi. The program would identify both MississippippississiM as well as MississippississiM as potential palindrome from the base word of Mississippi.


**Potential additions**
--------------------------
-None

**Thoughts**
--------
Mainly motivated by popular interview questions. I wanted to see if I could do this in a reasonable time, and was pleasantly surprised.
