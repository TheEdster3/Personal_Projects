Hey Professor, 

The program is a simple console application. It'll ask you if you want to do either surface area or volume, though the surface area results are questionable.
Shortly after it'll ask you for the number of points you'd like to place, followed by how many consecutive trials you wish to run.
It will print volume estimates as it runs and an average at the end, at least in the case of more than one consecutive trials.

I've included in this folder... 
-The report for the program in three different file formats.
-My main.cpp file
-A sphere class written to accompany it 
-Data used to produce the graphs in my report
-Two python scripts which graph the data output by the program

Thanks! 
This program was actually a lot of fun to write, and the concept is totally new to me. Pretty cool stuff.
