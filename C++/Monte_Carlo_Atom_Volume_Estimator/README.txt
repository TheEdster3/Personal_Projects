The program is a simple console application. It'll ask you if you want to do either surface area or volume.
Shortly after it'll ask you for the number of points you'd like to place, followed by how many consecutive trials you wish to run.
It will print volume estimates as it runs and an average at the end, at least in the case of more than one consecutive trials.

This program was actually a lot of fun to write, and the concept is totally new to me. Pretty cool stuff.
